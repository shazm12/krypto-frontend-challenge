This modal page indicates the sucessful placement of order.

# Improvements to my submission
Some of the improvements I need to make is to add loading screens so that I would render the dynamic contents of several pages only when they are ready to render. I would also work on the UI of pages like cart and such and also have a closer check on how the users are getting authenticated to main page (Products Page) and check if there are any issues with the pages , in case if some bugs and as per my intution there are some bugs in login and register , so if I had some more time I would have fixed that. 

# What would I do differently if you were allocated more time?

If I had more time, I would have a NoSQL DB like MongoDB and then create a GraphQL Server with Apollo for complex querying and even inserting or mutating data to the DB accordingly. I would also use cookies to store acccess token generated from every Login or Registration by JWT to validate and authenticate users at every time to access the web app. Also I would work on making the UI more responsive and clean my codebase and document it better for my fellow friends or anyone reading my code to understand it well.
