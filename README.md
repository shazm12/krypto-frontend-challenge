This is where users would place the order and also can delete the cart and once they place a order they will get a sucessful modal.

# Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes, there are some improvements in the code like I could make the UI for pages like Cart more better and also I would check for some bugs especially as per my intuition there are some bugs in login and register so I would fix that with also then cleaning up my codebase a bit more and writing more detailed description of some utility functions to let other peers understand what the function is actually doing.

# What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I would basically use a NoSQL DB like Mongo DB and then I would develop a Graph QL API with Apollo Server so that I could do complex queries and also inserting or mutating data in more efficient and faster way. Also , I would use cookeies to store user info and access token which we get everytime we authenticate a user so that we can contiuously check till when is user logged in and accordingly authenticate them on timely basis for better security and also improve the UI of some pages like Cart and Items Page and make them a bit more responsive.
